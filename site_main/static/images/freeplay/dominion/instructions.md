# Dominion

## Setup

First, give each player *7* Coppers and *3* Estates. Each player should shuffle their deck and draw 5 cards into their private hand.

Victory Cards (Estates, Duchies, and Provinces): *8* of each in a 2 player game, or *12* for 3 or more.

Curses: *10* for 2 players, *20* for 3, *30* for 4.

Kingdom cards: Choose *10* of these decks however you like, and delete the unchosen ones.

## Gameplay

There are 4 phases to a turn:

*Action*: You may play *1* action card from your hand, following the instructions on it. It may give you extra cards, extra buys, or even extra actions. (Play a card by taking it from your hand and laying it on the table.)
*Buy*: You may buy *1* card from any of the piles, by playing enough treasure cards from your hand so that they are at least up to the purchase price (given in the lower left corner of the card). If you have extra buys, you may make additional purchases, with each purchase subtracting from your credit. Credit does not carry over between turns.
*Cleanup*: All the cards in your hand, the cards played, and the cards bought go face up into your discard pile.
*Draw*: Draw *5* cards from your deck. If you don't have enough cards left, then flip over your discard pile, shuffle it, and continue drawing.

The game ends when all Provinces have been bought, or when any *3* other piles have been depleted. Whoever has the most victory points in their deck wins. If there's a tie, the player who went first loses.
