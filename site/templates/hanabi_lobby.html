    <h1>Hanabi Rules</h1>
    <p>
    Hanabi is a cooperative game in which you and the other players work together to build up five stacks of cards (one for each letter) starting with 1 and ending with 5. The collective score is found by counting all the cards successfully played in this manner, such that a perfect score is 25 points.</p>
    <p>The catch is that you can see the letter and number on your teammates' cards, but not your own. You rely on information that is selectively given to you by your teammates to know what you have.</p>
    <p>On your turn you may do one of three things:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Play</b> a card from your hand into the PLAY spot. The card is revealed, and if it can be placed on one of the five piles, it is. Otherwise, it is discarded and your team loses one of your three strikes. After 3 such mistakes, the game ends. If you build up a pile to 5, you regain a clue for your team.</li>
        <li><b>Clue</b> one of your teammates. By clicking/tapping a letter or number on a card in their hand, you will reveal to them ALL of that letter or number in their hand. You start with 8 clues, so use them wisely!</li>
        <li><b>Trash</b> a card from your hand. This action regains a clue for your team.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Not all cards are unique in letter and number. The deck is composed of 5 letters. In each letter, there are three 1s, two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, and one 5. Counting cards that are visible to you will be increasingly helpful at the end of the game.</p>
    <p>The game ends either when all the strikes have been used, or when a player cannot perform one of the three actions on their turn.</p>
