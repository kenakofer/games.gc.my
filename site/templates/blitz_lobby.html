    <p>
    Drag cards from your QUEUE and DUMP piles into the play area, where you can build stacks that start with 1 and go to 10 in each color. Click on your deck to deal 3 cards at a time into your dump. When the deck is gone, you can click on the DECK space again to put the dump cards back.
    <p>The game is over when one of the players has depleted the pile at the left of their queue. Your score is the number of cards you played minus 2 times the number of cards left in this pile.</p>
    <p></p>
