# Uno

Each player draws 7 cards to their hand. Play proceeds with each player taking a turn in order, abiding the following rules:

* If they have a card that matches in color, number or symbol, they may play that card. Some cards alter the flow of turns, or make the next player draw cards
* If not, and they have a wild card, they may play it, designating a new color.
* Otherwise, they must draw a card from the deck. If that card is playable by the above rules, it may immediately be played.

If a player reaches 1 card, and another player says "Uno!" before them, the former must draw 2 cards.

If a player runs out of cards, they are the winner.
