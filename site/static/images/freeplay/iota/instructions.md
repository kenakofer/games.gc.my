## Setup

Each player takes *4* cards from the deck into their private hand.

Take the top card off the deck and lay it face up in the middle of the screen to start the game.

## Gameplay

Turns go around the circle starting with the smallest player.

On their turn, a player may do either **play**, **exchange**, or **pass**:

**Play** any number of your cards in a line such that all new "words" created are valid. It's like scrabble.

A valid line has all the same or all different for the three features of color, shape, and number.

More explicitly, a line has all the same shapes, or none of the same shapes, as well as all the same color, or none of the same color, as well as all the same number or none of the same number.

A wild is played without designating what it is, but it must have some valid designation at all times. Another player who can swap out one of their tiles for the wild may do so on their turn as a free action, and put it in their hand.

After laying down cards, the player draws back up to 4 cards in their hand if they can.

**Exchange** any number of their cards with cards from the draw pile. _A la_ scrabble

**Pass** their turn, and take no action.

## Scoring

After a players lays down a line, that line and all other lines that have been extended are counted for points (like scrabble). The points for each card is the number on the card, and 0 for wild cards. Cards that are part of 2 lines are counted twice.

This base score is doubled for every line of 4 that is completed by the player. This effect compounds, so that 2 complete lines has a 4x multiplier.

## End game

The game ends when all cards have been drawn and one player plays their last card.

## Strategies

Remember that all 2 card lines are valid, so playing one line parallel to another is an easy way to get points.
